# Hey!  I'm Vivid

---

### I'm a high school student teaching myself different technologies that I'm interested in.  Currently, this list looks a bit like this:

- C# / .NET
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Git
- Linux Bash

I don't commit too often, but do about as much as I have time for.  I also do a variety of other things, like making VRChat content, playing Trombone, and watching way too much Youtube.

### Some of the technologies that I have plans for or would like to learn in the future:
- Java
- C++
- Minecraft Forge
- Game Dev with Unity
- K3s
- React.js + Three.js
- Penetration Testing

+ Electronic Music Making
+ Youtube / Filmmaking / Video Editing
+ Pretty much anything else I find myself to be interested in.
